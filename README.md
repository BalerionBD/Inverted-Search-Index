# Inverted-Search-Index
**Inverted Search Index in C:**

An Inverted Search Index is a data structure used to map terms to the documents they appear in, enabling efficient searching and retrieval. This C program implements an inverted index using efficient data structures to facilitate fast lookup operations.

**How It Works:**

1. **Indexing:**
   - The program reads a collection of documents and tokenizes them into terms.
   - It builds an inverted index, associating each term with the documents in which it appears.
   - Data structures like hash tables or balanced trees are utilized for efficient storage and retrieval.

2. **Searching:**
   - Given a search query, the program identifies relevant documents by consulting the inverted index.
   - It returns a list of documents containing the queried terms, ranked by relevance.

**Instructions:**

**1. Compilation:**
   - Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/inverted-search-index.git`
   - Navigate to the project directory: `cd inverted-search-index`
   - Compile the code: `gcc main.c inverted_index.c -o search_index`

**2. Usage:**
   - Indexing: `./search_index index <documents_directory>`
   - Searching: `./search_index search "<query>"`

**Example:**
   - Indexing: `./search_index index documents`
   - Searching: `./search_index search "information retrieval"`

**Notes:**
- Ensure documents are in plain text format for accurate tokenization.
- Customize the program to suit specific requirements, such as stemming or stop-word removal.
- Experiment with different data structures and algorithms for optimization.

This program offers a foundational implementation of an Inverted Search Index in C. Enhancements can be made to improve scalability, support for additional features, and overall performance. Contributions and feedback are welcome for further development..
